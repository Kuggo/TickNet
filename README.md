# TickNet V1.0:

**Ticknet** is a wireless communication protocol for CPUs in Minecraft. Here you can find all the schematics for all Network Interfaces/Nodes and their respective specifications.

# Ticknet in 5 mins
With Ticknet hardware one can create a network of Ticknet Nodes and communicate between them by sending and receiving packets. Packets are the combination of data being sent and some header that contains additional information that is useful for nodes to carry out the delivery process. 
## Payload
Data being sent is called payload and is a sequence of bytes that does not exceed the limit of 24 bytes. The payload can be null, meaning that a packet is only composed by the header. This might be useful for when a signal needs to be sent (acknowledge or ping) but no extra information besides the message itself is needed.
## Headers
Headers are automatically generated by the node and include (in this order): 
- A magic number. This is is a single byte that is always included so nodes know that the packet format is of Ticknet. Competing protocols will use another magic number.
- The length of the packet. It might be relevant for memory allocation purposes on the receiver side and for compatibility between other competing standards.
- The sender of the packet. That information is a single byte containing the static TN address of the node. Nodes are identified with this.
## Packet Properties
Packets sent have a few relevant properties: Consecutive packets sent between TN nodes arrive in the same order they were sent, no packets get duplicated in the process and only go missing in very specific and clearly defined scenarios:
-  The destination node is offline (turned off)
- The sender/receiver node does not have enough memory to save the transmission
These properties allow for a very reliable and efficient network.

## Node Interface
Nodes are controlled using a simple interface based on I/O ports.
